Movie Genre Classification: Create a model to predict a movie's genre using its plot summary or textual information. Techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings combined with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVMs are recommended.
Credit Card Fraud Detection: Develop a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of transaction information. Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests can be used for classification.
Customer Churn Prediction: Build a model to predict customer churn for subscription-based services. This involves using historical customer data, including usage behavior and demographics, with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting.
Spam SMS Detection: Create an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVMs are suggested.
Handwritten Text Generation: Implement a character-level RNN to generate handwritten-like text. The model should be trained on a dataset of handwritten text examples.
